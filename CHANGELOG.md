# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Agents** — multi-step LLM workflows defined declaratively as a graph spec (`spec_version: "1"`), with `llm` / `tool` / `end` nodes, edges, and a `tools` block that combines built-in tools, MCP servers, and user functions. Runtime persists checkpoints between steps so runs resume; events stream over SSE/WebSocket.
- `services/agent-runtime` — Python service that compiles and executes graph specs. Calls upstream models through the existing AI gateway (no separate per-agent keys), enforces per-agent limits (steps, tool calls, parallel tools, wall clock, human timeout), emits `run_start`, `node_start/end`, `tool_call_start/end`, `llm_token_usage`, `run_paused`, `run_cancelled`, `run_failed`, `run_end`.
- Agents REST API on `control-api`: agent CRUD + `validate`, runs (`POST /runs` with body-hash idempotency, `GET`, `cancel`, `resume`, `events.json`, SSE `events`), public-mode runs for `visibility: "public"` agents (with one-time stream tokens, SSE + WebSocket), and MCP-server registration (`list/add/delete/probe`).
- **Function-as-agent-tool**: `app_functions.agent_tool`, `agent_tool_description`, `agent_tool_mode` (`read_only` | `read_write`), `agent_tool_exposed_to` (`developer_only` | `end_user`). The Python runtime loads any function with `agent_tool=true` that's listed in the agent spec's `tools.functions[]`. `read_write` tools pause the run for human approval before mutating.
- **Multi-trigger functions** — functions can now declare multiple triggers as `triggers: [{type, config, enabled}]` (one per type, enforced by a DB unique index). New trigger types `s3_upload` and `webhook` join the existing `http`, `cron`, `websocket`. The webhook handler generates a signed URL and routes verified inbound payloads to the function.
- MCP server agent tools (6): `list_agents`, `get_agent`, `create_agent`, `update_agent`, `delete_agent`, `validate_agent_spec`. `deploy_function` and `manage_function` gain `agent_tool*` parameters and the canonical `triggers` array (legacy singular `trigger` retained).
- CLI: `butterbase agents list|get|create|update|delete`. `butterbase functions deploy` gains `--agent-tool`, `--agent-tool-description`, `--agent-tool-mode`, `--agent-tool-exposed-to`. `butterbase functions list` shows trigger types and a 🤖 marker for agent-exposed functions.
- SDK (`@butterbase/sdk`): `DeployFunctionParams` / `FunctionSummary` / `FunctionDetails` extend a shared `AgentToolFields` mixin; `FunctionSummary.triggers` is the canonical plural array.
- `runtime-plane` migration 020 drops the dead `agents.byok_override` column (added but never read by routes — BYOK is handled at the AI router, not per-agent).
- Docs: new `core-concepts/agents`, `getting-started/agents-quickstart`, `api-reference/agents-api`. Refreshed `core-concepts/functions` and `api-reference/functions-api` for the multi-trigger cutover and `agent_tool*` fields. CLI doc updated with `bb agents` and the new `bb functions deploy` flags.
- Example bundles in `Examples/agents/`:
  - `support-readonly` — triage → answer LLM nodes calling a `read_only` function tool.
  - `approval-hitl` — single LLM node with a `read_write` tool; demonstrates the `run_paused` → approve/deny flow.
  - `mcp-docs` — external MCP server (Stripe docs) referenced via `tools.mcp_servers`.

### Changed

- **`POST /v1/{app_id}/functions`** now canonically accepts `triggers: [{type, config, enabled}]`. The legacy singular `trigger` is still accepted and normalized server-side to a 1-element array via `normalizeTriggers()`. `GET /functions` and `GET /functions/{name}` return the plural `triggers` field; the legacy singular `trigger` is no longer in the response.
- SDK admin types: `FunctionSummary.trigger?: FunctionTrigger` → `triggers?: FunctionTrigger[]`. Response-shape tests updated; request-shape tests retain the singular shorthand to exercise the back-compat shim.
- MCP `manage_function` list response type declares `triggers[]` to match the actual API response.

### Fixed

- `cli functions list` previously read `func.trigger?.type` (which is no longer in the response), causing a literal "undefined" to print. Now reads `triggers[].type` joined.
- Dashboard `FunctionsPage` and `FunctionDetailPage` previously crashed in render on the singular `fn.trigger.type` after any mutation refetch returned the new plural shape. Pages now consume `triggers[]` directly and support add/remove of all 5 trigger types in the editor — no more silent downgrade of webhook/s3_upload/websocket triggers to HTTP on save.
- Dashboard agent editor: model dropdown reads from `useAiCatalog(appId)` (the same source as `AiModelsPage`) instead of a hardcoded 5-entry list, so newer / app-configured models actually appear.
- Dashboard agent editor: cross-references `graph_spec.tools.functions[]` against `useFunctions(appId)` and surfaces a yellow warning when a referenced function either doesn't exist or has `agent_tool=false` (runtime would silently drop these — now caught before save).
- `manage_app` MCP tool tests updated for the consolidated `link_substrate` / `set_clone_webhook` / `unlink_substrate` actions.

### Removed

- `agents.byok_override` column (runtime-plane). Never read by control-api agent routes or the Python runtime; the dashboard's BYOK toggle has also been removed. BYOK as a user-facing concept no longer exists for agents — the platform-level BYOK infrastructure (AI router, key encryption tables, billing attribution) is untouched.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Key-Value Store** — first-class KV primitive across SDK (`ctx.kv`), REST (`/v1/:app_id/kv/*`), CLI (`butterbase kv …`), and MCP (`manage_kv`). Regional (us-east-1, us-west-2), per-app quota-protected, `move_app`-aware. See `docs/kv`.
- Customer dashboard KV tab — usage, expose rules, key browser, recent errors.
- Admin dashboard KV page — cluster health, top apps, hotspots.
- `audit_logs` table + `kv-audit-writer` plugin recording every 4xx/5xx KV response.
- Bytes-on-TTL sidecar size index for accurate storage counters across expirations.

### Fixed
- `resolveKvAuth` accepts platform-owner JWTs as apiKey identity (unblocks dashboard KV tab).
- Service-key validation runs before dev escape hatch (MCP/CLI calls now attribute to real owner).
- `PUT /v1/:app_id/kv/_expose` bulk-replace endpoint (unblocks dashboard expose-rule save).
- MCP api-client handles 204 No Content responses without throwing.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-20

### Prior development

Butterbase was developed privately from 2026-02 through 2026-05 by NetGPT Inc. This OSS release represents the data-plane core; multi-region orchestration, billing logic, AI router upstream provider adapters, and managed-service dashboards remain in a private cloud repo that consumes this repo as the source of truth.
